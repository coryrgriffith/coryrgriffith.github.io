											<h2>A brief history of me and how i got here</h2>
											<h3>A generic one column layout</h3>

											Web developer with experience in Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, C++, and Python. Creating web apps using various frameworks such as Rails, Vue.js, and Bootstrap for robust and interactive applications. I didn’t start my career in coding, but I’m excited for it to be back in my life.
										</p>
										<p>
											How did I get to this point you may ask? I started out my college career not knowing what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I enjoyed and was good at math and science, so I thought studying electrical engineering at the University of Iowa was a great choice. I completed three years of coursework before realizing that I did not want to do that for the rest of my life.
										</p>
										<p>
											Starting the summer after my first year of college, I worked with individuals with disabilities in various recreation settings. I enjoyed helping these individuals to participate and seeing them improve different aspects of their lives through recreation. I decided that this was what I wanted to do and so I changed majors and transferred schools in order to achieve this goal.
										</p>
										<p>
											After graduating with my B.S. in Recreation, I worked in the community setting of special recreation associations and park districts. I worked with children and seniors, individuals both with and without a wide range of abilities and disabilities. I was responsible for all of the adults with intellectual disabilities programs, including Special Olympics, at one agency. At another agency I planned and oversaw all of the programs for seniors as well as community-wide special events for families ranging in size from 400 to 1,200.
										</p>
										<p>
											After nearly four years in recreation, I knew it was time to make a change. I yearned to be challenged. I missed the excitement I felt during my programming class at the University of Iowa when I solved a problem or learned a new concept. I needed some coding in my life. I found Actualize, and reignited my passion to learn and challenge myself in my career.
